        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p> I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. I came to the United States not too long ago
            to study computer science. However, unlike most people studying computer science,
            college was my introduction to programming in general. I have always had a knack
            for logic, math, and science, as well as being an avid gamer and technology enthusiast,
            Despite not having any experience in it, I did know I would enjoy programming.</p>
        
        <p> I never thought to learn to program on my own, because I have
            always been systematic about learning and did not want to learn from random tutorials.
            I am glad I waited because now I feel like I have a solid foundation in programming.
            Now I am not only in love with programming, but I discovered a passion for networking,
            web development, and languages. </p>
